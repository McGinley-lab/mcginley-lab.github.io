### Computing resources
For most analysis projects, your lab computer or laptop will be sufficient to run Python / Matlab.
. If you need more heavy lifting, there are currently three few options:
- Station 1
  - Specs:
  - There is currently one account called jwdegee
  - Login physically from the lab, or via AnyDesk
- Station 2
 - Specs: 
 - Ask JW de Gee to create an account for you.
 - Login via `ssh -YCX username@10.34.12.20`.
- Station 3
 - Specs: 
 - Ask JW de Gee to create an account for you.
 - Login via `ssh -YCX username@10.34.12.43`.

### Python and data analysis basics
* Know your way around the command line
    * [Basic cheatsheet](https://github.com/moriahtaylor1/teaching-materials/blob/main/infographics/GIT%20GUIDE%20Part%201%20-%20INTRO.png)
* Understand what a virtual environment is
  * [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and create your first environment.
* Understand Git and GitHub
  * [GitLectures](http://git-lectures.github.io)
  * [Git primer by Brad Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/git/git-primer/)
  * Make a GitHub account, practice with a test repo.
  * Further practice: this wiki repo, add something in the [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and submit a pull request (see Home for instructions on how to contribute to the wiki).
* Learn the basics of Python
  * [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/bdca0f873fb4e2a3d00f489268470b8eef78a1eafcde11c025950376eed73c9c) has very good adaptive programming courses. Sign up with your _@umail.leidenuniv.nl_ address using the link for free access.
  * [Intro to Python, by Todd Gureckis](http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall20/labincp/chapters/03/00-python.html)
  * Students at Leiden University can follow the [Introduction to Python course, offered by LIACS](https://stepik.org/course/73333/promo).
  * Download a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environments). I like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (you can create a free educational account), other great options are [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
   [Atom](https://atom.io/). 
   * If you're happy with a simpler solution, you can use a text editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) + the trusted Mac OS Terminal (not sure about Windows).
   *  You can also access [DataCamp learning resources](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/a6bb93f6866b8ced468d96d1406e020a421592ea) with your Leiden Uni account.
   * When setting up your project, make sure you're running it in the right virtual environment to access all your packages.
* Think about the structure of data
    * [The structure of data, by Todd Gureckis](http://gureckislab.org/courses/spring21/labincp/chapters/05/00-data.html)
    * Learn to work with the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) and
     [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) packages for data handling and visualization.
